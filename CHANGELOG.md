# bex changelog

A rust library for working with boolean expressions.

## 0.1.4 (2020-06-13

**vid::VID**
- `VID` is now an explicit custom type rather than a simple usize.
  It accounts for both "real" variables (`var()`) and virtual ones (`vir()`), as
  well as the meta-constant `T`  (true) which fills the branch variable
  slots for the `I` and `O` BDD nodes.

**smaller variables now appear at the bottom of BDD, ANF graphs.**
- A new type for `VID` comparison was introduced - `vid::VidOrdering`. This
  lets you `cmp_depth` using terms `Above`, `Level`, and `Below` rather than
  the `Less`, `Equal`, `Greater` you get with `cmp`. There was no technical
  reason for this, but I found it much easier to reason about the code in these terms.
- `VidOrdering` is set up so that branch variables with smaller
  numbers move to the *bottom* of a BDD. There are numerous benefits to doing
  this - cross-function cache hits, immediate knowledge of the width of a
  node's truth table, and (most importantly) a much simpler time converting
  from ANF to BDD.
- There is currently no support for the "industry standard" ordering - the
  plan in the future is just to make sure the graphviz output shows variable
  names, and then you can just re-arrange the labels.

**NID as universal ID**
- `ASTBase` now uses `nid::VID` for input variable identifiers, and `nid::NID`
  for node identifiers, rather than using simple `usize` indices. This means
  we no longer need to store explicit entries for constants and literals.
- The `Base` trait no longer takes type arguments `N` and `V`, since all
  implementations now use `nid::NID` and `vid::VID`.

**Reg type**
- `Reg` provides an general purpose register containing an arbitrary number of bits.
- Bits in a Reg can be accessed individually either by number (with `get(ix)`
  and `put(ix,bool))`, or using a `VID` (`var_get`, `var_put`). Indexing by virtual
  variables is not supported.
- `Reg` also provides a simple `increment()` method, as well as the more general
  `ripple(start,end)`. These treat the register as a binary number, "add 1" at a
  specified location, and ripple-carry the result until a 0 is encountered, or
  the carry overflows the end position. This is all intended to support `Cursor`.

**Cursor**
- `cur::Cursor` combines a `Reg` with a stack of `NID`s to provide a tool for
  navigating through the terms or solutions in a BDD/ANF-like graph structure.

**BDDBase**
- You can now call `solutions()` on a `BDDBase` to iterate through solutions of
  the BDD. Each solution is presented as a `Reg` of length `nvars()`.

**ANFBase**
- The new `anf` module contains the beginnings of a BDD-like structure for working
  with expressions in algebraic normal form (XOR-of-ANDs). These two operations
  plus the constant `I` give a complete functional base. The implementation does
  not yet take advantage of multiple cores.

**code cleanup**
- Swarming is now the only implementation for BDDBase. (#7)
- `cargo test` now runs quickly, without generating diagrams (#3)
- Unify the AST and BDD "Base" interfaces. (#2, #5)
  - `base` now contains only the abstract trait `Base` (formerly `TBase`)
  - `Base` methods now act on associated types `Self::N` and `Self::V`,
    rather than `NID` and `VID` directly.
  - The old `struct base::Base` is now `ast::ASTBase`. Methods `sid`, `sub`,
    and `when` (which might not apply to other implementations) have been
    moved out of `trait Base` and into `struct ASTBase` directly.
  - The old `base::{Op,SID,SUB,NID,VID}` types have also moved to the `ast` module.
  - `bdd::BddBase` now implements `base::Base`.
  - Some of the tests for `ast` and `bdd` have been macro-fied and moved into `base`.
    These macros allow re-using the same test code for each `Base` implementation.
- The `bdd::NID` type and associated helper functions have been moved into `nid`
  so the same scheme can be reused for other `Base` implementations.

**documentation**
- Began writing/collecting more documentation in the
  [doc/](https://github.com/tangentstorm/bex/tree/main/doc) directory.

## 0.1.3 (2019-09-24)

I got most this working back in December and then put it all aside for a while.
It's still pretty messy, but I'm starting to work on it again, so I figured I
would ship what I have, and then aim for more frequent, small releases as I
continue to tinker with it.

**multi-threaded workers**
- refactored `bdd` so that the `BddState` is now owned by a `BddWorker`.
  Further, both `BddState` and `BddWorker` are now traits.
- Moved `BddWorker` implementation into `SimpleBddWorker`.
- Provided multiple implementations for `BddState` -- (so far,
  one with and one without array bounds checking).
- Added a multi-core bdd worker: `BddSwarm`. Between threading and an
  out-of-order execution model that results in potential short circuiting,
  `ite()` calls that once took 30 or more seconds on my low-end 2-core
  laptop now run in 0 seconds!

**code tuning**
- added `solve::sort_by_cost` which optimizes the astâ†’bdd conversion
  to take only one `bdd_refine_one` step per AST node
  (improved my still-external benchmark script by an order of magnitude).
- in `bdd`, `ite_norm` now constructs hi/lo nodes directly from
  input rather than calling `when_xx`. This resulted in about a 23% speedup.

**(rudimentary) example programs**
- `examples/bdd-solve.rs` demonstrates one method of using bex
  to solve arbitrary problems. (Albeit very very slowly, still...)
- `examples/bex-shell.rs` is a tiny forth-like interpreter for
  manipulating expressions interactively.
- See [examples/README.md](https://github.com/tangentstorm/bex/tree/main/examples)
  for more details.

**other improvements**
- `solve::ProgressReport` can now simply save the final result instead
  of showing it (as `dot` can take a very long time to render it into a png).
  It also now shows progress as a percentage (though only currently accurate
  when `sort_by_cost` was called)

## 0.1.2 (2018-12-17)

- added `Cargo.toml` documentation link to [docs.rs/bex](https://docs.rs/bex/)
- added this changelog

## 0.1.1 (2018-12-17)

- Renamed `bex::x32` to `bex::int`, used macros to generalize number of bits,
  added `times`, `lt`, and `eq` functions
- Added `bex::solve` for converting between ast and bdd representations.
- Added distinction between `real` (input) and `virtual` (intermediate)
  variables in `bdd::NID`
- Added graphviz (`*.dot`) output for `base::Base` and improved formatting
  for `bdd::BDDBase`
- Various performance enhancements for `bex::bdd`. Most notably:
  - switched caches to use the `hashbrown` crate (for about a 40% speedup!)
  - added inlining hints for many functions
  - re-ordered logic in bottleneck functions (`norm`, `ite_norm`) to minimize work
  - `bdd::NID` is now a single u64 with redundant information packed into the NID itself.
    This way, decisions can be made looking at the NID directly, without fetching the
    actual node.
  - Disabled bounds checking for internal node lookups. (unsafe)
- Refactored `bex::bdd` in preparation for multi-threading.
  - Grouped the internal node lists and the caches by branching variable (VID).
    This isn't actually an optimization, but I expect(ed?) it to make concurrent
    solving easier in the future.
  - moved all the unsafe, data-mutating operations into a handful of
    isolated functions on a single source page. These will likely be
    factored out into a new `Worker` struct, eventually.
